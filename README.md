# Forecapp: A Full-Stack Web Application enabling modern Forecasts

This repository contains FORECAPP - an open-source web application enabling anyone without coding and data science skills to run state-of-the-art forecasts. 
FORECAPP is built on top off NeuralProphet, a Neural Network based Time-Series model, inspired by [Facebook Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet) and [AR-Net](https://github.com/ourownstory/AR-Net), built on PyTorch.

Forecapp is currently deployed [here](https://forecapp.herokuapp.com/) ðŸš€

## How it works 

![userflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58265021/166840405-474c9430-4063-4d66-bb57-c07c08e63721.png)

### Step 1

User uploads file by drag and drop or selection via file browser. Forecapp automatically parses file and generates data insights.

### Step 2

Forecapp plots the current timeseries data and allows user to specify model parameters for training. Model training starts after submission of model configurations.

### Step 3

User can analyze the forecast and repeat Step 2 to finetune model parameters.
